extension Kernel.Thread {
    /// A serial executor backed by a single dedicated OS thread.
    ///
    /// Conforms to both `SerialExecutor` (for actor pinning via `unownedExecutor`)
    /// and `TaskExecutor` (for `withTaskExecutorPreference`).
    ///
    /// ## Safety Invariant
    ///
    /// This type is `Sendable` by virtue of internal synchronization: the job
    /// queue (`jobs`), the shutdown flag (`_shutdown`), and the stored thread
    /// handle (`threadHandle`) are all mutated exclusively under
    /// `wait: Executor.Wait.Condvar` -- a mutex + condition variable wrapper.
    /// `enqueue`, `runLoop`, and `shutdown` each route their state accesses
    /// through `wait.withLock`, and cross-thread wake-ups go through
    /// `wait.wake()` / `wait.wake.all()`. The caller MUST interact with the
    /// executor only through its public API (`enqueue`, `shutdown`, the
    /// unowned-executor accessors); reaching into the stored state otherwise
    /// is undefined behaviour.
    ///
    /// ## Intended Use
    ///
    /// - Pinning Swift actors to a dedicated OS thread via `unownedExecutor`
    ///   (`.serial` mode).
    /// - Running jobs under `withTaskExecutorPreference` with a task-executor
    ///   identity (`.task` mode).
    /// - Workloads that need deterministic OS-level thread identity (e.g.,
    ///   thread-local state, TLS-backed subsystems, priority pinning).
    ///
    /// ## Non-Goals
    ///
    /// - Not a work-stealing pool. For fan-out across N threads with stealing
    ///   use `Kernel.Thread.Executor.Stealing`.
    /// - Not safe to shutdown from its own thread. Doing so deadlocks -- the
    ///   implementation detects the case and detaches instead of joining.
    /// - Not idempotent on shutdown. `shutdown()` must be called exactly once
    ///   before the executor is deallocated; a second call traps.
    ///
    /// ## Run Identity
    ///
    /// The executor reports the correct identity when running jobs (otherwise
    /// the Swift Concurrency runtime re-enqueues indefinitely):
    /// - `.serial` (default): `runSynchronously(on: serialExecutor)` -- use
    ///   for actor pinning via `unownedExecutor`.
    /// - `.task`: `runSynchronously(on: taskExecutor)` -- use with
    ///   `withTaskExecutorPreference`.
