// Linux today; Darwin users can inject a custom Kernel.Completion (for
// testing or future backends), so the type compiles there as well. On
// Windows the ecosystem plans a separate Kernel.Thread.Executor.IOCP
// sibling per executor-package-design.md Decision #6.

extension Kernel.Thread.Executor {
    /// Single-thread executor whose wait primitive is a kernel completion
    /// resource.
    ///
    /// One OS thread, one job queue, one owned `Kernel.Completion`. The run
    /// loop interleaves drain-jobs with the proactor phase cycle
    /// (flush → drain → maybe-wait → drain) on the completion resource,
    /// then delivers the drained events to a consumer-supplied tick body.
    /// Tick receives a `wait` thunk that either returns the buffer of
    /// completion events from the cycle or throws the kernel error.
    ///
    /// ## Event Flow
    ///
    /// ```
    /// drain jobs
    ///   → flush pending submissions
    ///   → drain completion queue
    ///   → if empty: block on kernel notification
    ///   → drain again
    ///   → tick(wait: try or catch)
    ///   → repeat
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The consumer never sees the phase ordering. Submissions made by
    /// actor methods during `drain jobs` (via `executor.kernel.submit(…)`)
    /// are guaranteed to be flushed before any blocking wait — the
    /// flush-before-wait constraint of completion-based I/O is encoded in
    /// the run loop and cannot be violated by the consumer.
    ///
    /// ## Backend Neutrality
    ///
    /// This executor references only `Kernel.Completion`,
    /// `Kernel.Completion.Error`, and `Kernel.Completion.Event`. It names
    /// no platform backend (io_uring, IOCP, or otherwise). Any future
    /// backend that fits the `Kernel.Completion` contract is served
    /// without modification.
    ///
    /// ## Error Policy
    ///
    /// The executor does not classify kernel errors. Every outcome —
    /// success or failure — is delivered via the typed-throws `wait`
    /// thunk. Tick catches with `throws(Kernel.Completion.Error)` and
    /// decides whether to `.continue` (optionally yielding first) or
    /// `.halt`. Consumers that need transient-error retry implement it in
    /// tick; consumers that treat any error as fatal return `.halt`
    /// directly.
    ///
    /// ## Race Safety
    ///
    /// The tick body runs on the executor's own thread — the same thread
    /// that dispatches actor jobs. Domain state touched by tick is
    /// single-threaded.
    ///
    /// ## Safety Invariant
    ///
    /// This type is `Sendable` by virtue of internal synchronization.
    /// Cross-thread mutable state is guarded as follows:
    /// - `jobs` / `drainBuffer` : protected by `queueLock: Kernel.Thread.Mutex`.
    ///   Every `enqueue` / `drainJobs` operation serializes through
    ///   `queueLock.withLock`.
    /// - `_shutdown` : atomic `Shutdown.Flag`.
    /// - `_kernel` : the `~Copyable` completion resource is thread-confined
    ///   to the executor's OS thread; it is taken out of its `Optional`
    ///   slot for the duration of each iteration's I/O phase and
    ///   restored before tick runs. Cross-thread wakeup is delivered via
    ///   the separately-held `kernelWakeup: Kernel.Wakeup.Channel`
    ///   (`Sendable` by construction).
    /// - `threadHandle` : mutated only at construction and shutdown
    ///   boundaries.
    ///
    /// The caller MUST interact with the executor only through the public
    /// API (`enqueue`, `shutdown`, the unowned-executor accessors, the
    /// `kernel` coroutine-scoped accessor); reaching into stored state
    /// otherwise is undefined behaviour.
    ///
    /// ## Intended Use
    ///
    /// - Completion-based I/O executors where actor jobs, kernel
    ///   submissions, and kernel completions are all multiplexed on the
    ///   same thread (e.g., `io_uring`-driven I/O on Linux).
    /// - Foundation-layer proactor threads that serve a single owner
    ///   actor.
    ///
    /// ## Non-Goals
    ///
    /// - Not a Windows executor (see `#if !os(Windows)` guard). A future
    ///   `Kernel.Thread.Executor.IOCP` sibling will serve that role.
    /// - Not a work-stealing executor. Single-threaded by design.
    ///
    /// ## Lifecycle
    /// Call `shutdown()` before deallocation.
