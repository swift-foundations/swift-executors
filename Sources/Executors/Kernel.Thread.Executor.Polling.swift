extension Kernel.Thread.Executor {
    /// Single-thread executor whose wait primitive is a kernel event source.
    ///
    /// One OS thread, one job queue, one `Executor.Wait.Event.Source`. The run
    /// loop interleaves drain-jobs with a blocking poll on the event source,
    /// then delivers the poll outcome to a consumer-supplied tick body. Tick
    /// receives a `wait` thunk that either returns the events from the cycle
    /// or throws the driver error.
    ///
    /// ## Event Flow
    ///
    /// ```
    /// drain jobs → wait → tick(wait: try or catch) → repeat
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The run loop blocks in `waitSource.wait()` until kernel events arrive
    /// or the wakeup channel fires (from `enqueue()`). Domain-specific event
    /// dispatch and error policy both live in the tick body — errors are
    /// NOT silently retried by the executor.
    ///
    /// ## Error Policy
    ///
    /// The executor does not classify driver errors (EINTR, ENOMEM, EAGAIN,
    /// or fatal). Every outcome — success or failure — is delivered via the
    /// typed-throws `wait` thunk. Tick catches with `throws(Kernel.Event.Driver.Error)`
    /// and decides whether to `.continue` (optionally yielding first) or
    /// `.halt`. Consumers that need transient-error retry implement it in
    /// tick; consumers that treat any error as fatal return `.halt` directly.
    ///
    /// ## Race Safety
    ///
    /// The tick body runs on the executor's own thread — the same thread that
    /// dispatches actor jobs. Domain state touched by tick is single-threaded.
    /// See research doc V5.
    ///
    /// ## Safety Invariant
    ///
    /// This type is `Sendable` by virtue of internal synchronization. Cross-
    /// thread mutable state is guarded as follows:
    /// - `jobs` / `drainBuffer` : protected by `queueLock: Kernel.Thread.Mutex`.
    ///   Every `enqueue` / `drainJobs` operation serializes through
    ///   `queueLock.withLock`.
    /// - `_shutdown` : atomic `Shutdown.Flag`.
    /// - `waitSource` : the kernel event source's wakeup channel is MPSC-safe
    ///   by construction (POSIX `eventfd` / kqueue-signal equivalents); reads
    ///   of the event buffer happen exclusively on the executor's own thread
    ///   inside `runLoop`.
    /// - `threadHandle` : mutated only at construction and shutdown boundaries.
    ///
    /// The `tick` closure fires on the executor's own thread -- the same
    /// thread that dispatches actor jobs -- so domain state touched by `tick`
    /// is single-threaded w.r.t. that executor's actor jobs.
    ///
    /// The caller MUST interact with the executor only through the public
    /// API (`enqueue`, `shutdown`, the unowned-executor accessors, the
    /// `source` coroutine-scoped accessor); reaching into stored state
    /// otherwise is undefined behaviour.
    ///
    /// ## Intended Use
    ///
    /// - Event-loop executors where actor jobs and kernel events must be
    ///   interleaved on the same thread (e.g., epoll/kqueue-driven I/O).
    /// - Foundation-layer reactor threads that multiplex timers, descriptor
    ///   readiness, and actor work on one OS thread.
    ///
    /// ## Non-Goals
    ///
    /// - Not a Windows executor. Depends on `Kernel.Event.Source` which
    ///   requires epoll (Linux) or kqueue (Darwin). A future
    ///   `Kernel.Thread.Executor.IOCP` sibling will serve the Windows role.
    /// - Not idempotent on shutdown -- safe to call from any thread
    ///   (including the executor's own thread), but not from inside the
    ///   `tick` callback at the same moment.
    /// - Not a work-stealing executor. Single-threaded by design.
    ///
    /// ## Lifecycle
    /// Call `shutdown()` before deallocation.
