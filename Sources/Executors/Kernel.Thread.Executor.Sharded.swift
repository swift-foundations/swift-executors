extension Kernel.Thread.Executor {
    /// A sharded pool of serial executors for parallel work dispatch.
    ///
    /// Distributes work across N independent `Kernel.Thread.Executor` instances
    /// via round-robin selection. Each executor has its own OS thread and
    /// serial job queue.
    ///
    /// ## Thread Safety
    /// This type is `Sendable`. The round-robin counter uses atomic operations,
    /// making `next()` safe to call from any thread without synchronization.
    ///
    /// ## Lifecycle Requirements
    /// **IMPORTANT**: The pool owns its executor threads and must be explicitly shut down:
    ///
    /// 1. Call `shutdown()` before the pool is deallocated
    /// 2. Do NOT call `shutdown()` from any of the executor threads (deadlock)
    /// 3. After shutdown, the pool cannot be reused
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// let pool = Kernel.Thread.Executor.Sharded(.init(count: 4))
    /// defer { pool.shutdown() }
    ///
    /// let executor = pool.next()
    /// // Use executor for task dispatch or actor pinning
    /// ```
