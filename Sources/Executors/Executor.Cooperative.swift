extension Executor {
    /// Runs on the caller's thread; no OS thread spawned.
    ///
    /// Caller drives the run loop explicitly via `run()`. Closest analogs:
    /// Tokio `current_thread`, futures-rs `LocalPool`, Apple `CooperativeExecutor`.
    ///
    /// ## Safety Invariant
    ///
    /// This type is `Sendable` by virtue of internal synchronization: the
    /// job queue (`jobs`), condition variable (`wait`), and shutdown flag
    /// (`_shutdown`) are mutated exclusively under `wait: Executor.Wait.Condvar`
    /// -- a mutex + condvar wrapper. `enqueue`, `run`, and `shutdown` route
    /// state accesses through `wait.withLock`. The caller MUST interact with
    /// the executor only through its public API; touching the stored state
    /// directly is undefined behaviour.
    ///
    /// ## Intended Use
    ///
    /// - Single-threaded cooperative task execution on the caller's thread
    ///   (e.g., test harnesses, deterministic simulation, REPL drivers).
    /// - Unit tests that need a drain-to-completion executor without
    ///   spawning an OS thread.
    ///
    /// ## Donation Contract
    ///
    /// - **Yield policy:** Snapshot-then-check. Each iteration drains a
    ///   snapshot of pending jobs, then re-checks the exit condition.
    ///   Prevents the infinite-drain bug the stdlib hit and fixed
    ///   (`0fbd382e9ca`, `bd27a14ea00`).
    /// - **Revocation:** `runUntil(_:)` accepts a condition callback;
    ///   `stop()` signals the innermost invocation to return.
    ///   Revocation latency is bounded by the longest single job
    ///   execution, not by sleep duration (condvar wakes on enqueue).
    /// - **Completion guarantee:** Always. `run()` returns on `shutdown()`
    ///   or `stop()`. `runUntil(_:)` returns when the condition is
    ///   satisfied, or `stop()`/`shutdown()` is called.
    /// - **Priority:** Caller-owned. The donated thread runs at the OS
    ///   priority of the donating context. The executor does not adjust it.
    ///   FIFO drain order for v1.
    /// - **Re-entrancy:** Prohibited. Nested `runUntil` / `run()` traps.
    /// - **`stop()` vs `shutdown()`:** `shutdown()` dominates. If both are
    ///   in flight, the executor exits permanently. `stop()` alone halts
    ///   the innermost `runUntil`; `shutdown()` halts everything and is
    ///   irreversible.
    ///
    /// ## Non-Goals
    ///
    /// - Not a TaskExecutor. Cooperative scheduling implies serial actor
    ///   identity; task-executor semantics are not offered.
    /// - Not multi-thread. Enqueues from other threads are allowed, but
    ///   execution is always on the `run()` / `runUntil` caller.
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// let executor = Executor.Cooperative()
    /// // From another task:
    /// executor.enqueue(job)
    /// // On the calling thread:
    /// executor.run()              // blocks until shutdown() or stop()
    /// executor.runUntil { done }  // blocks until done or stop()/shutdown()
    /// ```
